    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_1">Crows, wipe the blood from the end of your claws\nSaid the vulture\nLets gather like storms for the war\nCrows, as the night turns its skin into coal\nDark as corpses but cluttered with gold\nThey will label you thieves, wolves, and whores\nBut you are nothing less than angels\nCast down and covered in black\n\nAin\'t this the bloodiest mess in the world? Said the virgin, a torn little girl\nBoy, you went and made a sweet wreck of my soul, and I\'ve already forgiven you\n\nAnd blood was running down\nHer dress in streams into her hands where she\nWas stitching on the flesh had left\nIn sections on the carpet near a bed that\nNever slept while she was sleeping\nIn her clothes that he had laid with on\nThe floor with all his fingers crossed\nIn hoping that that distance\nWouldn\'t grow\nBut how it grew\nAnd how it hurt\nAnd how it hallowed every memory had\nNever felt was threatened by a thing the world\nCould conjure up to kill them, but he let it kill them\nWhat a bunch of fools we lovers are\nAnd now shes smiling, with her self put back together\nJust a shadow of the past before the war\nAll sewn together, like a city sick from storms\nAnd sick of waiting for a god to call the floods out of her home\nWhat a bunch of fools we lovers are\nWhen tempted by the taste of flesh\n\n\"My boy, you are nothing more than a thief and a whore\nIn a suit of the finest of armor.\" laughed the vulture\n\"Pathetic little child, I am embarrassed for you.\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_2">Pick up the phone\nBlessed be the thief, disguised in skin\nAnd blessed are the fingers that gesture him in\nPaint the receiver\nTo the side of the fake\nLying at the bottom of the staircase\nBroken elbows, and your coming through the window\n\nAnd whoever called night a blanket\nHad never the felt the cold\nAnd whoever called the night a blanket\nSo use your fingers, darling, and\nTear away at the restraints they call the body\nIt\'s the temporary things that rip us apart\nFor the body is but a piece of art for you to tear to pieces\n\nThis is history to thievery\nThese are only games we play\nHang up the phone</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_3">I\'m reading over your shoulder\nIt says it in every line, in every curve and crack\nIt says it in every detail of your face\nUnmistakably apparent in this dull light\nTracing a separate letter, forming a separate word\nTwisting together to build the same beautiful sentence\nThe same painful realization\nThe cracks in your lips\nOpen with the books and\nThe smile shows the lines in your face\nPerfectly crooked, and perfectly familiar\n\nAnd for the moment, uncovered like a statue\nLay perfectly still. to show the cracks in your lips\nGive purpose to this pattern, and start to smile\nBurst into flames, disappear\nBefore your best intentions can no longer hide her ears\nFrom that which will make them bleed\nBefore your own two hands become too weak to hold the blood inside her wounds\nBefore reality explodes before you in a brilliant flash of spectral fires\nInto a thousand fragments of a past, long dead and gone\n\nThis is remembering the last time we touched\nThe last time we spoke\nWords ricocheting off empty tables\nVandalizing the pictures on these smoke-stained walls\nAnd i can feel your mouth as it opens from across the room\nYour tongue and lips forming the shape of your laughter\nIt\'s the curve of your stomach, its the bend in your legs\nIt\'s the remnants of the pages framed in the cracks of your bleeding lips\nIt\'s the curve of your stomach, it\'s the bend in your legs\nYour crooked teeth\n\nI\'m reading over your shoulder\nIt says it in every line, in every curve and crack\nThe same stupid message in every stupid bend and in every stupid stitch\nIn every inch of our peeling skin\nIt\'s tracing letters in the same sentence\nIt\'s screaming the same stupid thing\nLike the howling of a plane playing over and over and over and over and over</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_4">Oh, you\'ve a pretty mouth\nLeave your lips to linger on my skin and\nKiss me one last time\nI will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter\nSleeping in the sutures of the city\'s skin\nMake yourself remember me in cold and concrete\n\nWhen will you realize this city makes you real\nWhen will you realize your demons make you real\n\nOh, you\'ve a pretty mouth\nLeave your lips to linger on my skin and\nKiss me one last time\nI will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter\nSleeping in the sutures of the city\'s skin\nMake yourself remember me in cold and concrete\nIt\'s the way my hands felt lying still beneath your dress\n\nI am transparent\nI am a greenhouse filled with ghosts\n\nOh dear god, oh my god\n\nWhisper secrets, speak in a hushed voice\nThe first thing that you learn is that you never let them hear you\nIn a soundproof room, in a windowless world\nKeep your voice down or dull your words\nThen put on your bedroom face for him\nAll pursed lips and half-closed eyes with pink-stained skin\nScreaming for sleeping hands on downed dresses\nScreaming for dead legs come alive\nFor dead legs come alive\n\nOh dear god\nThere is no excuse for me</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_5">We move by instinct, darling\nLet our hands be hatchets\nLet us wander blindly, swinging madly \nIn a forest made of flesh\n\nWe move by instinct, darling\nLet our eyes like lepers drive\nThe doubters from our homes and\nInto the bottom of the sea\n\nAnd we speak in signals, darling\nLet our smoke stitch pictures\nLet us twist in patterns\nDull the horror of a city still on fire\n\nFor we are like medics handling\nSuicide by cyanide with bleeding fingers\nLet us suffer, completely inadequate\n\nAnd we move like lovers, lover\nLet me run my fingers down your side\nAnd kiss you right below the eye\nWe sleep with shadows but\nWe never give them bread\n\nOh horror, dress yourself in shame\nOr I will tear a hole in you, you harlot\nBurn your eyes\n\nI will hold your\nWhite-washed bones unto the sky and\nScream \"oh god, if you are there\nI hold this body to your judgment\nGive it your wrath or your mercy\nBut please pick wrath\"</string>
