    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_1">Crows, wipe the blood from the end of your claws\nSaid the vulture\nLets gather like storms for the war\nCrows, as the night turns its skin into coal\nDark as corpses but cluttered with gold\nThey will label you thieves, wolves, and whores\nBut you are nothing less than angels\nCast down and covered in black\n\nAin\'t this the bloodiest mess in the world? Said the virgin, a torn little girl\nBoy, you went and made a sweet wreck of my soul, and I\'ve already forgiven you\n\nAnd blood was running down\nHer dress in streams into her hands where she\nWas stitching on the flesh had left\nIn sections on the carpet near a bed that\nNever slept while she was sleeping\nIn her clothes that he had laid with on\nThe floor with all his fingers crossed\nIn hoping that that distance\nWouldn\'t grow\nBut how it grew\nAnd how it hurt\nAnd how it hallowed every memory had\nNever felt was threatened by a thing the world\nCould conjure up to kill them, but he let it kill them\nWhat a bunch of fools we lovers are\nAnd now shes smiling, with her self put back together\nJust a shadow of the past before the war\nAll sewn together, like a city sick from storms\nAnd sick of waiting for a god to call the floods out of her home\nWhat a bunch of fools we lovers are\nWhen tempted by the taste of flesh\n\n\"My boy, you are nothing more than a thief and a whore\nIn a suit of the finest of armor.\" laughed the vulture\n\"Pathetic little child, I am embarrassed for you.\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_2">Pick up the phone\nBlessed be the thief, disguised in skin\nAnd blessed are the fingers that gesture him in\nPaint the receiver\nTo the side of the fake\nLying at the bottom of the staircase\nBroken elbows, and your coming through the window\n\nAnd whoever called night a blanket\nHad never the felt the cold\nAnd whoever called the night a blanket\nSo use your fingers, darling, and\nTear away at the restraints they call the body\nIt\'s the temporary things that rip us apart\nFor the body is but a piece of art for you to tear to pieces\n\nThis is history to thievery\nThese are only games we play\nHang up the phone</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_3">I\'m reading over your shoulder\nIt says it in every line, in every curve and crack\nIt says it in every detail of your face\nUnmistakably apparent in this dull light\nTracing a separate letter, forming a separate word\nTwisting together to build the same beautiful sentence\nThe same painful realization\nThe cracks in your lips\nOpen with the books and\nThe smile shows the lines in your face\nPerfectly crooked, and perfectly familiar\n\nAnd for the moment, uncovered like a statue\nLay perfectly still. to show the cracks in your lips\nGive purpose to this pattern, and start to smile\nBurst into flames, disappear\nBefore your best intentions can no longer hide her ears\nFrom that which will make them bleed\nBefore your own two hands become too weak to hold the blood inside her wounds\nBefore reality explodes before you in a brilliant flash of spectral fires\nInto a thousand fragments of a past, long dead and gone\n\nThis is remembering the last time we touched\nThe last time we spoke\nWords ricocheting off empty tables\nVandalizing the pictures on these smoke-stained walls\nAnd i can feel your mouth as it opens from across the room\nYour tongue and lips forming the shape of your laughter\nIt\'s the curve of your stomach, its the bend in your legs\nIt\'s the remnants of the pages framed in the cracks of your bleeding lips\nIt\'s the curve of your stomach, it\'s the bend in your legs\nYour crooked teeth\n\nI\'m reading over your shoulder\nIt says it in every line, in every curve and crack\nThe same stupid message in every stupid bend and in every stupid stitch\nIn every inch of our peeling skin\nIt\'s tracing letters in the same sentence\nIt\'s screaming the same stupid thing\nLike the howling of a plane playing over and over and over and over and over</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_4">Oh, you\'ve a pretty mouth\nLeave your lips to linger on my skin and\nKiss me one last time\nI will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter\nSleeping in the sutures of the city\'s skin\nMake yourself remember me in cold and concrete\n\nWhen will you realize this city makes you real\nWhen will you realize your demons make you real\n\nOh, you\'ve a pretty mouth\nLeave your lips to linger on my skin and\nKiss me one last time\nI will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter\nSleeping in the sutures of the city\'s skin\nMake yourself remember me in cold and concrete\nIt\'s the way my hands felt lying still beneath your dress\n\nI am transparent\nI am a greenhouse filled with ghosts\n\nOh dear god, oh my god\n\nWhisper secrets, speak in a hushed voice\nThe first thing that you learn is that you never let them hear you\nIn a soundproof room, in a windowless world\nKeep your voice down or dull your words\nThen put on your bedroom face for him\nAll pursed lips and half-closed eyes with pink-stained skin\nScreaming for sleeping hands on downed dresses\nScreaming for dead legs come alive\nFor dead legs come alive\n\nOh dear god\nThere is no excuse for me</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_5">We move by instinct, darling\nLet our hands be hatchets\nLet us wander blindly, swinging madly \nIn a forest made of flesh\n\nWe move by instinct, darling\nLet our eyes like lepers drive\nThe doubters from our homes and\nInto the bottom of the sea\n\nAnd we speak in signals, darling\nLet our smoke stitch pictures\nLet us twist in patterns\nDull the horror of a city still on fire\n\nFor we are like medics handling\nSuicide by cyanide with bleeding fingers\nLet us suffer, completely inadequate\n\nAnd we move like lovers, lover\nLet me run my fingers down your side\nAnd kiss you right below the eye\nWe sleep with shadows but\nWe never give them bread\n\nOh horror, dress yourself in shame\nOr I will tear a hole in you, you harlot\nBurn your eyes\n\nI will hold your\nWhite-washed bones unto the sky and\nScream \"oh god, if you are there\nI hold this body to your judgment\nGive it your wrath or your mercy\nBut please pick wrath\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_6">Don\'t call this an art project\nThis is science, this is progress\nAnd don\'t pretend these are heartfelt words, we are\nChildren dressed as surgeons but disturbed by the sight of our scars\nAnd now we carry scalpels to trace the scarring resting somewhere\nOn the line between my house, your heart and into your home\nWhere you lay sleeping like a ceiling fan in winter\nGently turning as the wind reaches its fingers through the window\nJust to hold you, like I held you\nPressed like a rose between my fingers or like stones\nI keep in pockets meant to weigh me underwater\n\nThese scars will fade away but never disappear, my dear\nWe\'ll raise our fists like lightning to rods to god and\nIf he strikes us down\nThen he strikes us down\nBut first, let him hear us speak:\nWe are like the legacy of thunderstorms we watched and swore in doorways\n\"We will never be the same again.\"\n\nI can feel you healing and I hate it\nLike a harpist without hands you only bang the strings\nYou used to love to touch so much\nTo hear the dissonance drain violently and then dissolve\nLike all the songs I sang but never once could make you smile\nMy god, I would kill to make you smile\nAnd reach out to my hands, soft and frail\nTo make good on the love that you swear still exists, and still thrives\nThough we\'ve buried our bodies in blood and old lies\nLike, \"I\'m fine\" and \"you look so much better than him\"\nBut don\'t trust the surgeon with your heart\nShe\'s drunk and sips from poison cups, and\nDon\'t you trust the scientist\nHe says \"life is like a wineglass\" as he spills his drink\nLike secrets\nAll across your dress and says:\n\n\"My dear, I must confess\nI never thought you ever knew what love was like for real\nI never thought you needed me.\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_vancouver_7">Oh crashing airplane, where were you the day she left?\n\nUnderneath the laughs there lies a need\nThat nobody is getting\nAnd an honesty that doesn\'t stretch far enough\nTo show us all how much this will mean to us, my dear\nAnd when we\'re old we\'ll tell ourselves that we did\nEverything that we could to save this\nBut now we do nothing\n\nI\'ve slept for twenty years, but I\'ve acted strong at least\nIf you\'re leaving again, then you\'re leaving again\nAnd you\'re gone\nAnd I feel nothing anymore, so just keep walking away\nThirty-thousand steps\nI\'ll watch you for every second and never feel alone\n\nI\'ve been sleeping\nFor at least the last two years\nMy dear, my princess, my sister, my lover, my friend\nI made you a bed of thorns for every rose you ever left outside my door\nThat\'s all you ever left me\n\nLay your scars out in rows\nLay your scars out in rows\nLay your scars out in rows \nTo show me what I\'ve done to you\n\nLay your scars out in rows\nLay your scars out in rows\nIt was my weakness that couldn\'t save us\n\nSo lay your scars out in rows\nSo lay your scars out in rows\nSo lay your scars out in rows for me\n\nWe were one, and what are we now?\n\nAct strong, at least \nAnd don\'t turn around\nIf I\'m leaving, then I\'m leaving\nAnd I\'m leaving, and I\'m gone\n\nWe move as one</string>

    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_1">I think I saw you in my sleep, darling\nI think I saw you in my dreams you were\nStitching up the seams on every broken promise\nThat your body couldn\'t keep\nI think I saw you in my sleep\n\nI thought I heard the door open, oh no\nI thought I heard the door open but\nI only heard it close\n\nI thought I heard a plane crashing, but\nNow I think it was your passion snapping\n\nI think you saw me confronting my fear, it\nWent up with a bottle and went down with the beer and\nI think you ought to stay away from here\nThere are ghosts in the walls and they\nCrawl in your head through your ear\n\nI think I saw you in my sleep, lover\nI think I saw you in my dreams you were\nStitching up the seams on every mangled promise\nThat your body couldn\'t keep\nI think I saw you in my sleep</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_2">Up, M\'Lady, pack your things\nThis place is not your home\nNor was it ever, sever every tie\nTonight we ride, tonight we ride\n\nAnd how we\'ve trembled at the way that time\'s\nAssembled little fires of desire in the tundra of our skin\nSo, do yourself a little favor, savor every time you waver\nFor that shaking in my voice was only slyly feigned chagrin\nTonight we ride\n\nOh, Lover, uncover\nI know it\'s warm beneath your sheets\nAnd there is ice along the streets but listen\nLover, we will recover\nBut we\'ve no time to waste with meddling in affairs\nWe\'ve locked so tightly in our dreams\n\nWe are not clean, we are not pure\nWe can not rest until we\'re sure\nSo, rob your pretty little eyes of sleep\'s disguise\nI\'m at your bedside with a bucket full of lies\nSo, clear your ears and listen\n\nUp, M\'Lady, pack your things\nThis place is not your home\n\nBut I know what is\n\nAnd to the glorious past:\n\nYou\'ve opened my window but broken the glass\nAnd I beseech thee, \"shed thy beauty\"\nFor as a child leaves the womb and learns the cold\nYou have taught us perils in the present\nAnd you will bring us peril in our surely-soon-to-be\nUnless\n\nThe river\'s not flooded this time\n\nOh, precious distance\nOh, precious pain\nYou\'ve given me a name\nAnd etched it in the stones of the river bank\n\nOh, precious distance\nOh, precious pain\nYou\'ve given us a name\nYou\'ve given us a name\n\n\n\"Rise!\" Said the king to the river\n\"Never let up! No, bring us a flood and bring it hard!\"\n\"Freeze!\" Said the wind to the water\n\"Never give in, no, build us a bridge\nAnd build it strong and angry\nLet it still the king\'s decree\nOh, you must contemplate the current\nBoy, and command that coward cease\nThe boy breathes for his love says, \"I wait.\"\nHis love says, \"I wait.\"\nShe\'s shouting out, \"I will come back, yes, I will come back\nI will come, I have lived my life so uncomfortably \nDarling, come for me, come for me.\"\n\n\"Rise!\" Said the boy to his lover\n\"Darling, get up. I\'ve brought you my love, and brought it far!\"\n\"Leave!\" Said the girl to her lover\n\"I\'ve given in. If love is a bridge, we built it wrong!\"\n\nCurb your anger\nStill your fists\nShe will never come back, she\'ll never come back, she\'ll never come\nShe will never come back, she\'ll never come back, she\'ll never come</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_3">I\'ve come here as a man in shambles\nWorn out from begging on my knees\nPlease, I\'m just trying to keep my family together\nNow, when you saw you\'re lover wore a ring around her finger, why didn\'t you stop?\n\nI have half a mind to make you hurt, to make you bleed, to make you suffer\nI swear, if you\'ve touched her, oh heaven\nforgive what I would do to you, you monster\nAnd think about your children? \nThey\'ll never believe what you\'ve done\n\nListen, I\'m begging you, back off\nLet me rebuild all the things that you shattered\n\nShe meant it, I swear that she meant it, she whispered so often\n\"Husband, I\'ll always be here with you.\"\n\nBut always is always and always is valueless\nI wish I\'d never heard her speak a word\n\nAnd I hope you see us, your wife and your children and I\nBuried in the wreckage of your crime\nWhile you\'re laying down your sins\nSoftly leaning in to kiss your guilt goodnight\n\nShe is mine. You stole her, somehow tricked her but\nWe\'ll survive. We will. She loves me dearly, you\'ll see\nYou are blind, she loves me dearly\n\nBreathe in\n\nHe finally paused to take a breath \nThen looked down, it felt like staring into hell\nThe man was seated in a chair before him, silent\nA statue framed in pain and flesh. He thought\n\"Oh, what more can I say to sway him? To make this statue speak? \nI swear he\'s made of stone and I am barely stirring up a breeze.\"\n\nAnd after waiting in the silence\nFinally turned around to leave\nBroken and barely through the doorway\nBreathing slowly, beating hard, he heard him speak:\n\n\"I guess love\'s a funny thing, the way it fades away without a warning\nIt doesn\'t ask to be excused\nAnd when it\'s gone, oh it\'s gone, and it ain\'t ever comin\' back\n\nThere is nothing you can do to save it\nTo make it breathe the way it did when you were sliding on the ring\nTrust me, It\'s gone for good\n\nNow there is nothing you can do to stop me\nShe is happy when she is with me and I am finally alive. I\'m sorry.\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_4">She forced a smile, said\n\"Boy, come kiss my mouth, I\'ll set you free\nYou know that hope you\'re holding to? It looks an awful lot like fear\nNow, you\'re so quick to fall on failure, and so quick to raise your voice, like\n\'If I can\'t find a mistake to blame, we didn\'t have a choice.\'\n\nNo, but you had option\nI was your chance to feel complete\nBut when I leaned in close to you\nyou kissed your fear instead of me\n\nYou had my hand in your hand\nYou had my lip in your teeth\nYou had my heart on your sleeve\nYou had a chance to breathe\n\nBut, boy, you wouldn\'t let your fear recede so I moved on\n\nAnd it\'s too late to change your mind now\nYou got scared, boy, and I got gone\nNow you failed, and there\'s no way to turn back time\nYou had your chance, boy, I tried.\"\n\n\"You tried?\" I looked her in the eye and smiled\n\"My girl, you must understand that fear is not some product that I made\nIt crept unwelcome in my head the day they had her torn away\nIt changed me\n\nNow at the end of everyday I lie awake at night and wait\nTo feel the wires of my brain get cut and quietly rearranged, and\nHear my beaten heart exclaim, \'Still, I refuse to let her go.\'\n\nSo we escape to our mistakes for they wait patiently for us\nOh, how they always wait for me\n\nIf my fear has kept me here only my fear can set me free\n\nAnd I\'m sorry, dear, but don\'t you dare say another word\nHow could I risk holding your heart in me while still in love with her?\n\nYou were wrong.\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_5">Out where the stones lay like bones by the ocean\nOut where the waves crash contempt on the land\nSomeone was trembling for fear of the tempest\nSomebody silently reached for their hand\nSaid, understand that if you\'re cold I\'ll keep you warm\nAnd besides, there\'s so much beauty in a storm\nSo come down with me to the shore\nAnd what\'s more, I adore you\nSo tell me, what is there to fear\nYou think some seraph up above is trying to rob us of our love\nBecause the sky\'s not clear\nMy dear, you know there\'s not\nNow listen to the rain upon the rooftop\nBut the wind picked up\n\nOut where the stones stand up like thrones beside the ocean\nOut where the waves make a grave of the sea\nThe lovers struggled in the middle of the tempest\nAnd water angrily crawled up onto the beach\nSaid, hold my hand and stay with me\nWe\'ll be released\nBut the tide clung like an anchor to her feet\nAnd though he tried to make the water line recede\nIt pulled her out into the sea\nHe could not break apart the waves to bring her safely back in\nHe watched her hand break through the surface once\nThen disappear again\nForever wait inside the sea for my, my dear\nI hear you\nYou speak in every curling wave\nAnd sing in every violent breeze\nSomeday not far away from here\nMy dear, I swear I\'ll see you\nAnd we will hear the seraphs cry\nFor they will still envy you and I\nHow they envied you and I\nHow they envied you and I\nHow they envied you and I</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_6">Oh, we could blame it on our hands\nThey lifted the drink to our mouths so we drank it\nOr we could blame it on our bodies\nThey say, we like the way we feel when we get touched\nYou\'ve got your fingers snared in my veins\nI think it\'s time you pulled them out\nAnd I don\'t care about the flesh it\'ll tear\nIt isn\'t flesh that I\'m worried about\n\nWe held a match to keep our sight on the path\nBut the flame gave up and we lost it\nAnd I\'ve knelt for the last three years\nTrying to find it back with the blackened matchstick\nToday I\'m not afraid of failure\nThe past is a flower\nThe future, the snow\nI wasn\'t ever close to perfect\nBut I never let you go\n\nYou let your doubt lead you like a river on and on\nAnd you will never get back to save what you had\nHear me promise\nI will bury your problems in me\nSo sleep soundly\nI held your heart in my fingers\nNow it\'s gone, it\'s gone, it\'s gone and you will never admit\nThat you bid the wind blow the flames out\nAnd buried the coals in the sea\nYou tricked me\n\nYou came back and you brought floods\nWearing a necklace made of hearts that you\'d dragged through the mud\nAnd I guess I wasn\'t quite sure what to say to you\nBut then I saw mine, almost reached out to grab it\nSaid, darling, you\'re the only one on earth I want to have it\nBut now I\'m not so sure that was true\nAfter the hell you put it through\nBut there was no sharp pain this time\nJust the ghost of your presence compressing my chest like a vine\nAn unshakable absence\nLike most of my insides crawled out of my mouth and went west\nBut that\'s fine\nWe cast our hearts in plaster\nWe imagined our bodies were fashioned of stone\nBut they chipped at the brick and mortar\nWe found out that we\'re only layers of skin hiding bones\nAnd our bones are like chains, old and rusted in the rain\nThey\'re going to snap when the weight shifts\n\nYou moved like a fire through the forest\nYour hands were as red as the skin on your lips\nYou\'d been flirting with distance, princess\nI tasted its spit in your kiss\nOh mistress, know\nToday I will bury the flames of your failure\nThe past is a liar\nThe future, a whore\nI\'ll lay your bones into the earth and you will haunt my head no more\nOh, we could blame it on our hands\nOh, we could blame it on our hands\nBut it was our mouths that opened up to swallow\nOh, we could blame it on our hands\nAnd our heads that commanded us drink\nBut as I buried your flames in the dirt\nI watched the smoke pull your ghost from the grave\nAnd I fear they\'ll only lay in wait\nUntil we are face to face again\nJust when I said, I\'m moving, I\'m moving on\nI felt them come to life again and again and again and again\n\nThere are fires\nThat tear through valleys and make dust from grass\nThere are fires\nThere are wires\nBound in blue light, they pull us to the past\nThere are wires\nWe are tired\nWe should have known from the start that this wouldn\'t last\nWe are tired</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_7">My precious wife, I am in shambles\nI am crumbling, I am\nWas it something I did\nBid the tide to climb so high that it ripped our shore up\nI can fix it, I swear\nIf you trust me\nI am old and I am rusting but I care\nI care\n\nMy precious wife, we made a promise\nPledged our flesh to be one\nHow can you doubt a love that stood so proud as we raised our children\nI believe in it still\nIt has faltered and it has faded\nBut I know it\'s there\nHow\'d it change\nThe way you thought of me\nHow strange to think we once were lovers\nNow we\'ve wrapped the past up in broken glass\nAnd when you speak my name you shudder\nOh precious wife, believe I\'ll save this\nI\'ll revive it, I will\nWe\'ve built a family from this marriage\nWhy would you tear it apart\n\nOh speak now, precious\nYour silence screams\nYou\'re giving in to failure\nHear me, the promise that you made was meant to live forever\nUntil our deathbed, you\'re not allowed to change your mind\nWas there nothing in that promise\nAre you listening to me\n\nOh husband, I could not control it\nHusband, I could not abstain\nOne cannot stop the wind from blowing\nNor refuse the falling rain\nLove stirred up a storm inside me\nWrapped its arms around my waist\nI failed you dear, I\'m sorry, oh I\'m sorry\nThere was nothing I could do\nNo, there was nothing I could\nSure as the rain will fall\nSome love just fails without reason\nThere is nothing you can do\nThere is nothing you can do\nThere is nothing you can do\nThere is nothing you can do</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_8">Now speak of anger\nForget all the fears you\'ve kept about love and sex and death and faith\nErased, or swinging sweet from around her neck and between her breasts\nLet every lonely body finally break its fear of flesh and say\n\"How strange it must\'ve been back when we shook at the sight of sweat.\"\n\nLet our worries wander out of like water streaming from a spring\nAnd sing of all the things our heads have failed to ruin yet\nThere\'s so much they have failed to ruin yet\nBright as lightning, loud as thunder\nWe\'ll move all the hurt aside to let love sustain our passions\nAnd move up and onward\n\nWe are not our losses, we are only the extent to which we love\nSo build a home for your family, and build a castle for your friends\nNow set their beds with sheets and blanketã, keep them safe until the end\nI\'ve felt the damage and burn from the fallout\nMy love failed but theirs prevailed\nMy friends, I\'m only flesh and bone\nBut I won\'t let you die alone\n\nSo leave our hearts at the foot of the mountain\nLet our burdens be locked in the stone\nIf you will help me roll it upward\nI won\'t let you die alone\n\nI see a beauty springing upward from the earth and from out our hearts\nFor all the bad that seems to plague us, I swear to you there\'s good\nThey say that death is not a problem, it\'s a promise\nI can only say for sure that when it makes your bed I\'ll kiss your head \"Goodnight.\"\n\nSo speak of all the love we lost, and what it cost us\nLeft us beg our breath to stop but we kept on and\nWe were strong. We stayed bright as lightning\nwe sang loud as thunder, we moved ever forward\nWe are not our failures\nWe are love</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_9">You still cross my mind from time to time, and I mostly smile\nStill so set on finding out where we went wrong and why\nSo I retrace our every step with an unsure pen\nTrying to figure out what my head thinks\nBut my head just ain\'t what it used to be\nAnd then again, what\'s the point anyway?\n\nI remember you ascending all the stairs up to the balcony\nTo see if you could see me hidden quietly away\nAnd I remember the skin of your fingers\nThe spot three quarters up I\'d always touch when I was out of things to say\nYou held my hand, but you were too afraid to speak and I could never understand\nI remember when you leaned in quick to kiss me, and I swear\nThat not a single force on earth could stop the trembling of my hand\n\nAnd I remember how you smiled through the smoke\nIn a crowded little coffeehouse and laughed at all my jokes\nAnd I remember the way that you dressed and\nHow we wasted all the best of us in alcohol and sweat\nAnd I remember when I knew that you\'d be leaving, how I barely kept up breathing\nand I bet if I had to do it all again, I\'d feel the same pain\nAnd I remember panicked circles in the terminal in tears\nHow I wept to god in fits. I\'ve hated airports ever since\n\nIt must be true what people say, that only time can heal the pain\nAnd every single day I feel it fade away, but\nI still remember how the distance tricked us\nAnd lead us helpless by the wrist into a pit to be devoured\nI still remember how we held so strong to this\nThough we had never really settled on a way out\nI still remember the silence, and how we\'d always find a way\nTo turn and run to our mistakes\n\nI still remember how it all came back together just to fall apart again\nMy dear, I hear your voice in mine\nI\'ve been alone here, I\'ve been afraid, my dear\nI\'ve been at home here\nYou\'ve been away for years\nI\'ve been alone\n\nI breathed your name into the air\nI etched your name into me\nI felt my anger swelling\nI swam into its sea\n\nI held your name inside my heart\nBut it got buried in my fear\nIt tore the wiring of my brain\nI did my best to keep it clear\n\nSo, dear, no matter how we part\nI hold you sweetly in my head\nAnd if I do not miss a part of you\nA part of me is dead\n\nIf I can\'t love you as a lover\nI will love you as a friend\nAnd I will lay a bed before you\nKeep you safe until the end</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_10">I spoke too soon, it seems, for you made a home in my dreams\nWhile I slept you kept running yourself through my head\nLike, \"I won\'t be dead yet.\" I said, \"You don\'t understand\nWe had no control, they stole it; love\'s been so unfair to me.\"\n\n\"But see, boy, that\'s my point. You must move on.\"\nThen felt her ghost move in me\nI heard her voice call out my name but this time it faded out away\n\"I\'ll bury it today.\"\n\nSo I breathed her name out into a cold, cold room\nwatched her ghost ascend the walls and then dissolve\n\"This time I choose to let her go\nI will not let my fear become the only world I\'ve ever known\nI know my heart, kiss my mouth, set me free; I\'ve wounds to mend\nAnd we\'ll be more than friends, my dear\nI fear I\'ve changed my mind again.\"\n\"But boy, you\'re too late. Oh, God, it\'s too late.\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_11">They stored their passion in the creases in the corners of their mouths\nEvery angle of light from the open window washed their aged faces out\nThey said, \"Should we feel guilty for this sin? \nLord, did we kill a man and woman just to lie here skin to skin?\"\n\n\"I wasn\'t happy. I wasn\'t happy where I was\nWhat is life without a purpose? What is purpose without love?\nI pray my children will forgive me, though I bade the river flood\nI have washed my hands a thousand times but still can see the blood.\"\n\n\"Oh, great mercy, I am here to beg forgiveness for this mess\nI know I tore two worlds apart but I can\'t change the way I felt\nLove swept in like a storm and ripped the hinges from the doors\nLove poured in like a flood, I couldn\'t stop it anymore. I will not be drowned.\"\n\nShe said, \"Lover, come and hold me, I am terribly afraid\nWhile you\'re shouting at the stars, my scars are not fading away.\"\nHe said, \"Darling, I was begging heaven make them disappear, but\nSee, I didn\'t get an answer or at least one I could hear\n\nNow, I am thinking of the past and how we both said vows and lied and \nI am wondering how we trust ourselves to say a second time:\n\n\'To have and to hold\nFrom this day and onward\nFor better and for worse\nFor richer and for poorer\nIn sickness or in health\nTo love and to cherish \nTill death do us part?\'\"</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_12">I felt your sickness brush against my arm as I walked by you\nHeard your voice but couldn\'t tell that it was you\nAnd, slowly, watched your sickness slip away into a place\nThat I\'d once feared but I was not afraid this time\nSo I gave chase and found it, finally, slowly feeding from your head\nAnd from my friends, and from my family, so I grabbed it by the neck\n\"For every lover you have ruined\" I dug my nails into its flesh\n\"And every life that you have taken\"\nSlammed its head against the brick\nIts blood poured out onto the pavement\nI stirred it in with dirt and spit\n\"I will take a part of you.\"\nI made mortar from the mix\nTore every organ from its body\nBroke its bone and fashioned bricks\nI laid the mortar in between\nI made a throne for hope to sit\n\"Too long you\'ve torn us into pieces\nFirmly held onto our wrists. Today I bury you in me.\"\nI swallowed every inch of it\n\nI\'ll hold you, as you have held me\nYou\'ve held me in your heart, we\'ll be set free from fear\nWe\'ve felt our failures\nWe\'ve watched our passions leave, but we\'re still breathing on\nI\'ll hold you, as you have held me\nYou\'ve held me in your heart\nAnd I will hold you in my heart\n\nBut I still see him dead in the parking lot at the gas station just down the street\nAnd I still hear my friend say\n\"You know, you wouldn\'t believe the things I saw when I was stationed overseas.\"\nBut he somehow keeps smiling in spite all of that\nWhile I keep finding ways to push the good out for the bad\nOh, how selfish of myself to always say that it was more than I could take\nLike it was pain I could not shake\nLike it could break me with its fingers, throw my body in the lake\nAnd I would slowly sink away\nBut the Truth is it was sorrow that I made and would not face\nSee, I keep falling for the future after tripping on the past\nAnd I am always tearing sutures out to make the anguish last like it defines me\nOr reminds me I\'ve found comfort in my suffering\nAnd uncertainty in happiness and death\nBecause what\'s next is such a mystery to me\nI am terrified of all the things I feel but cannot see\nFriends and family, put your hand into my hand and lay your head into my chest\nYou are all that I have left here\nWe are all that we have left\nWe are the lovers, We are the last of our kind\nLink your arms and keep your chin up\nAnd I swear that we\'ll be fine\nWe are the lovers, We are the last of our kind\nThough we\'re not sure who we are, we keep our heads up \nThough we\'re not sure where we\'re from, we keep our hearts up\nThough we\'re not sure when we\'ll leave, we keep our heads up \nThough we\'re not sure where we\'ll go, we keep our hopes up\n\nKeep your head up; we\'re fine. Just keep your head up; I swear we\'ll be alright\nKeep your head up. Oh, my friends, keep your head up, and I swear we\'ll never die\nI swear we\'ll get home safe and sound, we\'ll live on underground\nI will give your heart a place to rest when everything you had has turned and left\nI\'ll weave your names into my ribcage; lock your hearts inside my chest\nRegain the passion I once carried; do away with all the rest\nI tore the sickness from your bodies; smashed its head against the bricks\nI made a castle from its bones that you may always dwell in it\nSo sing for every buried moment that you\'d thought would never end\nAnd sing your fears about the future; and a dirge for faded friends\nFor all the love that you had held to, why it somehow failed to keep\nAnd sing each minute you\'ve been frightened; every hour that you\'ve lost sleep\nAnd sing for all your friends and family; sing for those who didn\'t survive\nBut sing not for their final outcome; sing a song of how they tried\nWe live amidst a violent storm; leaves us unsatisfied at best\nSo fill your heart with what\'s important, and be done with all the rest\nWe are what\'s left of what we once were\nWe are falling far behind\nThere\'s so much stacking up against us and we\'re running out of time\n\nWe are but hopeful children, and we\'re the last of our kind\nBut if we let our hearts move outward, I know we will never\nWe are but friends and family, we are the last of our kind\nSo hold my hand, I\'ll lift your head up, and I promise we\'ll be fine\nWe are but hopeful lovers, and we are running out of time\nThere\'s so much stacking up against us, and we\'re falling far behind\nWe are but hopeful lovers, we are the last of our kind\nBut if we let our hearts move outward, I know we will never\nWe are but lovers, we are the last of our kind\nAnd if we let our hearts move outward, I know we will never\nWe are but lovers, we are the last of our kind\nAnd if we let our hearts move outward, we will never die</string>
    <string name="lyrics_satbotrbvaa_13">I know that someday you\'ll be sleeping, Darling, likely dreaming off the pain\nI hope you\'ll hear me in the streetlight\'s humming, softly breathing out your name\nI know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling, scars will remain\nI say we scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain\nAnd when they run into the river, oh no, let the water not complain\nI swear that even with the distance, slowly wearing out your name\nYour hands still catch the light the right way and\nOur hearts still beat the same\nAnd our hearts still beat the same</string>
